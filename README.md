Camel Case:

Time Complexity:
O(n) because we are using one for loop and it takes n time to iterate over it. It also takes the same time to convert from string to char

Space Complexity:
O(n)because if the length of the string is 'n' then the char would also be 'n'.


Correctness and the Loop Invariant:

Time Complexity:
O(n^2) because the wors case scenario is to have the whole list reveersed and we would have to use both the for loop and while loop.

Space Complexity:
O(1) constant since we are only taking in variables and the function does not grow.
